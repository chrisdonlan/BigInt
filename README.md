# Personal, Original Work

This is the personal, original work designed, architected and developed by me (Christopher Donlan) in total exclusion from any input or guidance from any individuals associated or affiliated with any organization whatsoever.   

I presented this as a code showcase in the pursuit of a job in June 2017, while working full time as a tech temp in GTRI. 

# Context

BigInt: arbitrary length unsigned integer with arithmetic, up to FFT multiplication. 


Work in progress; just for fun this summer. 

Src/ contains the important code
Tests/ contains the unit tests (Google Test setup)
